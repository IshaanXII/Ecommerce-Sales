E-Commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard:

Project Overview:

This project features a comprehensive E-Commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard built in Microsoft Excel. The goal of this project was to transform raw, unstructured e-commerce data into a dynamic and interactive visual tool that tracks Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and provides actionable insights into sales performance, profitability, and regional trends.

Files in this Repository:

1. Ecommerce-Sales.xlsx: The primary Excel workbook containing the raw data, processed data, pivot tables, and the final dashboard.
2. Dashboard.png: A high-resolution screenshot of the final dashboard for quick preview.

Key Features & KPIs:
The dashboard provides a high-level overview of business health with the following metrics (including Year-over-Year growth analysis):

Total Sales: $36,850.31 (↑ 31.47% YoY)
Total Profit: $977.29 (↓ 49.91% YoY)
Quantity Sold: 217 Units (↑ 19.74% YoY)
Number of Orders: 55 (↑ 26.52% YoY)
Profit Margin: 2.65% (↓ 61.90% YoY)

(Above figures are as per the attached dashboard image and will dynamically change as per the filters applied.)
